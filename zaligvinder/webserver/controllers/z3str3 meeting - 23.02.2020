z3str3 meeting - 23.02.2020
---------------------------
- unique feature instance pyex
  -> lots of string operations
  -> Federico want's to take a look at a probing

- Histogramm for string operations 
  -> Level of granularity up to me
---> FOR PROBING, HOW LONG SHOULD WE RUN THE SEQUENCE SOLVER



--- Validation with all other solvers
-> stable version as a validator. 

-> add total unknonws/errors etc. to total table



--- SEND BAD INSTANCES OF z3str4-murphy



--------- INFOS:

- Solved form: the the solution can essentially be read out of the formula -> substitute the solutiuon just into the formula
   > try to simplify a forumla to solved form.
   > trouble: overlapping variables ---- IDEA: bv algorithm; UNSATS by len-abs solver (multiset check?)
